def binary_search[CT: SupportsRichComparison](
    array: Sequence[CT], target: CT
) -> Optional[int]:
    """Uses binary search to find the target value in a sorted sequence.

    The array type and target type must be a Comparable type which supports at least the
    __lt__ (<) operator. Similar / related algorithms: bisect, lower_bound, upper_bound,
    insort, binary search tree.

    Sample:
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], target=5

    Complexity:
        Time: O(logn)

    Args:
        array (Sequence[CT]): The input sequence to be searched. This must be in
          (ascending) sorted order.
        target (CT): The target value to find.

    Returns:
        Optional[int]: The index where the target was found in the input array. If the
          target has multiple occurrences, one index will be returned. If the target is
          not found, returns None.

    This function has the difference with the core binary_search function in two ways.
    First, if the value is not found in the array, lower_bound will not return None, but
    an index where the target could be inserted while maintaining sorted order. Second,
    if there are multiple copies of the target, this function will return the leftmost
    index.
