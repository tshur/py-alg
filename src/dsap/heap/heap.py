class _Heap[CT: SupportsRichComparison](ABC):
    """Abstract heap data structure implementation using a list with custom comparator.

    The heap is organized such that the highest priority element is always at the
    front / root of the heap (index 0). After push/pop operations, we need to re-heapify
    (sift_up or sift_down) to maintain the heap invariant.

    We use a list because the heap will always be a complete binary tree. We can
    traverse to parent/child "nodes" via index manipulation. Left and right children are
    at 2i+1 and 2i+2, respectively. The parent node is at (i-2)//2.

    Values must support a Comparable type (at least support __lt__ operation). For
    MinHeap, the highest priority element is the "smallest"; for MaxHeap it is the
    "largest".

    Supports the following core algorithms:
     - from_iterable in O(n) time
     - push in O(logn) time
     - pop in O(logn) time
     - peek in O(1) time
     - consume_all in O(nlogn) time (n pop operations)
     - private methods to sift_up, sift_down, and heapify
