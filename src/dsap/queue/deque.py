class Deque[T]:
    """Doubly-ended queue supporting fast push/pop from both ends.

    Implementation uses a circular / ring buffer for space and memory. Other
    implementations exist, such as using a doubly-linked list of block arrays (such as
    used for collections.deque).

    The deque has a fixed capacity, which is increased (doubled) when the capacity is
    exceeded. The doubling requires copying to a new (larger) container, but leads to
    amortized time complexity.

    Common operations:
      - push_front, amortized O(1)
      - push_back, amortized O(1)
      - pop_front, O(1)
      - pop_back, O(1)
      - front, O(1)
      - back, O(1)
      - is_empty, O(1)

    # A ring/circular buffer to internally store the contents of the deque. We use a
    # ring buffer for amortized O(1) push from both sides, and space efficiency. We
    # manage the ring buffer via a _start and _size. The _start may not be at index 0,
    # and the elements may wrap around the end of the ring buffer. To ensure consistent
    # data storage, we perform _normalize(), _grow(), and _index() operations to remap
    # indexing and grow the capacity without invalidating the data.
