        1. Find all permutations (`''.join(...)` into string format).

        3. Sort the unique permutations.
        4. Find the index of our given input `s`.

    """Two-pointer approach: Find the characters to manipulate to get the next string.

    Insights:
        - We don't want to generate all permutations
        - How does itertools.permutations(...) work / what sequencing?
        - We always want to progress to a slightly larger string than before
            - Idea: What if we move a large character to the left (minimally)
            - Moving a small character to the left probably makes it smaller
        - If string is sorted in reverse order, return sorted string
        - *We can find the target substring to edit "easily"
            - As long as the string (from the right) is sorted non-increasing, it is the
              biggest ordering possible
            - When we find one character that is not ordered, we can do something to
              make that substring bigger

    Method: next_in_sequence('abcd')?
        1. Move left, while the sequence is not decreasing.
        2. When we find a smaller letter, mark that as the left bound
        3. Update the substring [left, end] to be slightly larger
            a. How? Let's try rotating it
